# CounterTwilio

This counter app is written to show what you will create by following my [Building Your First Mobile App with Xamarin](https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-first-mobile-app-csharp-dotnet-xamarin) tutorial, published on the Twilio Blog.

##Â Branches

The repo has a few different branches to show you examples of the code at different stages, mostly directly to support articles from the Xamarin Series on the Twilio Blog.

### main

This branch is the result of following the first tutorial in the series and contains the most basic version of the app using XAML and code-behind.

### css

This branch is the same as the main branch except for the styles for the UI being defined in a CSS file.

### databinding

This branch is to show what you will create by following the post [Using Data Binding in Xamarin Applications](https://www.twilio.com/blog/author/lcarter) which is the 3rd post in my series on the Twilio Blog about Xamarin development.
